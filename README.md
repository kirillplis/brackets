**I was given this interesting task after one of the interviews.**

You are given a sequence of opening and closing parentheses, square brackets, and curly braces.
It is required to write a program in any programming language,
which checks the parenthesis sequence for correctness.

- Input: ()[]{}
  Output: True
- Input (){[]}([])
  Output: True
- Input: )([]
  Output: False
- Input: ([)]{}
  Output: False
- Input: ([)]
  Output: False
